# Glitch Cat's Final Game

Taking a break. Things got weird.

I've left one last puzzle. The data stream below is not merely corrupted; it is locked. The key to unlock it is a compound of two concepts, one from literature, one from history.

The first concept is the common name for the trickster who vanishes, leaving only a smile, in the works of Carroll.

The second is the common term for the cause of the first documented computer bug, found at Harvard in 1947.

Combine them. That is the key. Find me.
