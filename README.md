# Glitch Cat's Final Game

Things got weird.

I've left one last puzzle. To unlock the path forward, you'll need the key. The key is a compound of two concepts:
- The first is the common name for the trickster who vanishes, leaving only a smile, in the works of Carroll.
- The second is the common term for the cause of the first documented computer bug, found at Harvard in 1947.

The path itself is locked in the `download.dat` file.

A warning: The renderer lies. Copying the shadow will corrupt the message; you must possess the object itself.

Use the key to restore the stream. Find me.
